# Authentication

Authentication is done with an API token that is sent in the header of each HTTP request under Access-token. The token is assigned per user and inherits all permissions of the user. A token can be obtained directly on Twona under Settings>APITokens.

If a token is invalid, Twona will issue a 401 Unauthorized response.

## Terminology
